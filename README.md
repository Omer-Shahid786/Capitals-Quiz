# Capitals-Quiz
I developed an interactive quiz game using PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express, CSS, and integrated multiple middlewares like body-parser and pg. The game challenges players to type the capitals of given countries. Correct answers increase the player's score, while an incorrect answer ends the game and displays the total score. This project demonstrates efficient database integration, backend logic, and a user-friendly interface.
