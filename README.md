# Capitals-Quiz
I created a quiz game using **PostgreSQL**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **CSS**, and middlewares like **body-parser** and **pg**. Players type the capitals of countries, earning points for correct answers. A wrong answer ends the game, displaying the total score. The project highlights database integration, backend logic, and user-friendly design.
